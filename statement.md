# Welcome!

This PHP template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```php runnable
<?php
echo "Hello World!";
$tableau = [ "jambon" => 4.95 , "pain" => 5.3 ];
var_dump($tableau["jambon"]);
?>
```

# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced PHP template](https://tech.io/select-repo/574)
